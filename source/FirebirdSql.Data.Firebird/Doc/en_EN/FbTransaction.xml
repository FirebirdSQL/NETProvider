			A single application may have multiple database connections, each with or without

			<remarks>
				<para>
				Savepoints offer a mechanism to roll back portions of transactions. You 
				create a savepoint using the <b>Save</b> method, and then later call the 
				<see cref="FbTransaction.Rollback(System.String)" /> method to roll back 
				to the savepoint instead of rolling back to the start of the transaction.
