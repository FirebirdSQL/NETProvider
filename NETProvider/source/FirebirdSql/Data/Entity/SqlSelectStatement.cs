    /// A SqlSelectStatement represents a canonical SQL SELECT statement.
    /// It has fields for the 5 main clauses
    /// <list type="number">
    /// <item>SELECT</item>
    /// <item>FROM</item>
    /// <item>WHERE</item>
    /// <item>GROUP BY</item>
    /// <item>ORDER BY</item>
    /// </list>
    /// We do not have HAVING, since it does not correspond to anything in the CommandTree.
    /// Each of the fields is a SqlBuilder, so we can keep appending SQL strings
    /// or other fragments to build up the clause.
    ///
    /// We have a IsDistinct property to indicate that we want distict columns.
    /// This is given out of band, since the input expression to the select clause
    /// may already have some columns projected out, and we use append-only SqlBuilders.
    /// The DISTINCT is inserted when we finally write the object into a string.
    /// 
    /// Also, we have a Top property, which is non-null if the number of results should
    /// be limited to certain number. It is given out of band for the same reasons as DISTINCT.
    ///
    /// The FromExtents contains the list of inputs in use for the select statement.
    /// There is usually just one element in this - Select statements for joins may
    /// temporarily have more than one.
    ///
    /// If the select statement is created by a Join node, we maintain a list of
    /// all the extents that have been flattened in the join in AllJoinExtents
    /// <example>
    /// in J(j1= J(a,b), c)
    /// FromExtents has 2 nodes JoinSymbol(name=j1, ...) and Symbol(name=c)
    /// AllJoinExtents has 3 nodes Symbol(name=a), Symbol(name=b), Symbol(name=c)
    /// </example>
    ///
    /// If any expression in the non-FROM clause refers to an extent in a higher scope,
    /// we add that extent to the OuterExtents list.  This list denotes the list
    /// of extent aliases that may collide with the aliases used in this select statement.
    /// It is set by <see cref="SqlGenerator.Visit(VariableReferenceExpression)"/>.
    /// An extent is an outer extent if it is not one of the FromExtents.

    /// Select statements and select expressions
    /// ----------------------------------------
    /// 
    /// Semantics:
    /// 
    /// A select statement is used to return data to the caller (PSQL module or the
    /// client program). Select expressions retrieve parts of data that construct both
    /// the final the result set or any of the intermediate sets. Select expressions
    /// are also known as subqueries.
    /// 
    /// Syntax rules:
    /// 
    /// <select statement> ::=
    /// <select expression> [FOR UPDATE] [WITH LOCK]
    /// 
    ///   <select expression> ::=
    ///     <query specification> [UNION [{ALL | DISTINCT}] <query specification>]
    /// 
    ///   <query specification> ::=
    ///     SELECT [FIRST <value>] [SKIP <value>] <select list>
    ///     FROM <table expression list>
    ///     WHERE <search condition>
    ///     GROUP BY <group value list>
    ///     HAVING <group condition>
    ///     PLAN <plan item list>
    ///     ORDER BY <sort value list>
    ///     ROWS <value> [TO <value>]
    /// 
    ///   <table expression> ::=
    ///     <table name> | <joined table> | <derived table>
    /// 
    ///   <joined table> ::=
    ///     {<cross join> | <qualified join>}
    /// 
    ///   <cross join> ::=
    ///     <table expression> CROSS JOIN <table expression>
    /// 
    ///   <qualified join> ::=
    ///     <table expression> [{INNER | {LEFT | RIGHT | FULL} [OUTER]}] JOIN <table expression>
    ///     ON <join condition>
    /// 
    ///   <derived table> ::=
    ///     '(' <select expression> ')'
    /// 
    /// Conclusions:
    /// 
    /// * FOR UPDATE mode and row locking can only be performed for a final dataset,
    /// they cannot be applied to a subquery
    /// * Unions are allowed inside any subquery
    /// * Clauses FIRST, SKIP, PLAN, ORDER BY, ROWS are allowed for any subquery
    /// 
    /// Notes:
    /// 
    /// * Either FIRST/SKIP or ROWS is allowed, they cannot be mixed together
    /// (a syntax error is thrown).
    /// 
    /// * INSERT statement accepts a select expression to create a dataset to be
    /// inserted into a table. So its SELECT part supports all the features defined
    /// above.
    /// 
    /// * UPDATE and DELETE statements are always based on an implicit cursor
    /// iterating through its target table and limited with the WHERE clause. You
    /// may also specify the final parts of the select expression syntax to limit
    /// the number of affected rows or optimize the statement. The following clauses
    /// are allowed at the end of the UPDATE/DELETE statements: PLAN, ORDER BY and
    /// ROWS.
